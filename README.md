# legalisation-assessment-alpha

This repo contains the wiki reflecting the digital by default work for the **alpha phase** of the legalisation project. It includes all the alpha prompts and evidence presented at the time of the assessment.

> As the project has moved into beta, ongoing updates are now happening in the separate legalisation-assessment repo. Please do not edit this one - it serves as the record of where we were at alpha.
